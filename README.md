# Network_Intrusion_detection
The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a software-based tool designed to monitor and analyze network traffic to detect suspicious activities or potential security threats in real time. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and rule-based detection mechanisms, this system aims to provide a robust solution for identifying unauthorized access, malicious traffic, and network anomalies.
